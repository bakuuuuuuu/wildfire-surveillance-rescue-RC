# wildfire-surveillance-rescue-RC
This project develops an RC car for wildfire monitoring and human rescue using YOLOv5 for detecting humans and flames. The car, controlled remotely, streams real-time video via a Raspberry Pi. Upon detection, the system sends alerts and emails the detected images to designated recipients.
